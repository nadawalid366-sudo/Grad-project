# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

## Backend setup

A starter Express backend is available in the `backend` folder.

1. Install backend dependencies

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

2. Create your environment file

   ```bash
   copy .env.example .env
   ```

   Set MongoDB in `backend/.env`:

   - `MONGODB_URI` (local or Atlas connection string)
   - `MONGODB_DB` (database name)

   Optional for frontend app (root `.env`):

   - `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000`

3. Run the backend API

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

You can also run backend scripts from the project root:

```bash
npm run backend:dev
```

Default API URL: `http://localhost:5000`

Available starter routes:

- `GET /`
- `GET /api/health`
- `GET /api/v1/ping`

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
